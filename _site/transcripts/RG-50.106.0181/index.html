<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">End of File OneMarch 1, 2010 Beginning File Two
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Irene Silver. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">And you were talking about your experience raising your children and — and their religious —
ANSWER:  Affiliations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  Well, that was about it, as far as that, you know, that — they’re — they’re all bringing up their children in the Jewish tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Since I was never that deeply steeped in religion, certainly I — I don’t feel that they should be doing anything different. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And — but I’m happy about the — the way that they are being brought up in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Are you more comfortable with people who lived through the war, than let’s say Americans here, who never had to experience what you experienced? </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Are you angry that others — that you had to experience things that others didn’t have to, by living in a different <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I am basically — I’m basically very tolerant. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I don’t judge other people, and the fact that I had to live through the war, and others didn’t, I’m happy that some people didn’t have to experience it. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Of course, I’m angry that — that the people who were there, and — and suffered, that — that, of course, is a very deep anger, but youMarch 1, 2010 can’t be angry forever, you can’t think about it forever, or your life will become miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And am I more comfortable? </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Not necessarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I have very close friends who have never gone through an — through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">But I do feel more comfortable, and be f — and — and are close to those friends of mine who — who understand, as much as they can, what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I don’t think I would be very comfortable with people who say, well, you know, what happened, happened, and let’s just forget about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I would not want to hear that. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">There’s one other thing that sometimes comes up, and it really, I think is unfair and bothers me; 1s when people say, well, why didn’t the Jews rise up? </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Why did they just go there like sheep? </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Well, times were very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Civilians did not have any arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">They couldn’t defend themselves against an army. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">How could a civilian without any arms, stand up to an army, with — with guns and ammunition, and — and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And in the end, there were those who were still surviving in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , who did fight, and they fought to the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">But that was at the very, very end, and they felt they would try to do anything they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">But the general population, they had no way to defend themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">In the beginning, nobody knew about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , at least I don’t know if they — that’s what I hear, that they didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I certainly was too young to know anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">But I don’t know if my family knew about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I think that eventually it became clear that people who went never cameMarch 1, 2010 back, and they — that there were these camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">But I just don’t want to hear people saying, why did they not fight back? </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I’d like to see how they would feel if they were in that situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Now of course, anybody can get a gun, and anybody, just about, can defend themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">But I don’t know what would happen if that ever happened again, I hope it never does, but y-you should never judge people if you have not been in that situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  Are you a different person because of what you experienced?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">When I was still with my parents, even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I was not only — I was an only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I was — trying to think of the right word, I was doted upon. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">My mother would feed me — first the nan — my nanny and then my mother would feed me til I was probably about seven or eight years old, because I didn’t like to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And so there was always somebody taking care of me, I was really well taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And because I was with my family, and with — with my parents, I didn’t feel that I had to behave in any certain way. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I don’t know how I did behave, but I’m sure I could do whatever I really wanted, if 1t was safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">But when I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and I was with strangers, I learned to be not only obedient, but not to annoy other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And so I think that I became more tolerant of others. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I think that I was spoiled when I was very young, but I didn’t gr — but after that I didn’t grow up very spoiled, I — I always had to — when a child grows up like my children, for instance, if you are not March 1, 2010 happy about something, you let your parents know. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Well, when they’re not your parents, you’re not going to let them know. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And even — even with my aunt and uncle, who were certainly my closest family, but still, they were not my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And so, I was very careful most of my life, as to how I behaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Now, other than that, I — I don’t know if I would have grown up to be a social worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Probably not, if the war hadn't happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I don’t know what — what would have happened, what kind of person I would have been, if the — the war hadn't happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I would hope that my war experiences have helped to make me into a person who cares about others.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  What about an inner strength, to cope with crises?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Well, I haven’t really made up my mind about that, because I’ve had a number of crises in my life since the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Health crisis, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And sometimes I think that those — that when you have a lot of trauma in your life, that makes you stronger, but sometimes I think, might work the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And I haven’t really come to any conclusion on that, for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I think I am — I think with age you become stronger. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I — I — I think most people will say that they’re stronger than they were when they were younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I know I — I— I was much — not that I’m a noisy person, but I was more of a quiet, do what others want you to do person. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I will standMarch 1, 2010 up for myself more now. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But that may be age. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I don’t know if it just makes — if it’s my experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Do you receive reparations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  I got some, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I — I didn’t — I did not want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">When I was in my 20s, my uncle said to me once — asked me if I wanted to apply for it, and m — I said, I don’t want any money from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they cannot repay me. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And I didn’t for the longest, longest time, apply for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And then eventually, I did, and it — I did because I — it changed my view upon it. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I thought then, will never repay me, but if my life can be made a little better, maybe it’ll help my children, then why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Why should it stay there, I’d rather have it here. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And so the — ma — my son actually has done all — anything that’s been done, it’s my older son has started that. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">He pushed me into everything that I have done on this — in this <span class="REGION">area</span> , and that — that’s about it, what happened lately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Do you dream about the war years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">At least, I don’t usually remember what I dream about, so it — I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Maybe I do, but I — I honestly don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Were you active in the civil rights movement, because what happened to the Jews, being deprived of their civil rights?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I mean, I certainly sympathize with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">March 1, 2010
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  But I wasn’t active in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I was very busy raising my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I really — I felt terrible about all of — all of it, and — and wished everybody all — you know, to get all their rights, and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I always felt that way, but I would not say that I — I was an — active in it, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  What were your thoughts about the Eichmann trial? </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Did that bring up any memories for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  It didn’t bring up memories, but I was certainly glad that they had gotten ahold of him, and — and whatever punishment was due, let — let that happen then. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And I’m certainly upset about some of the people who have gotten away in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> or wherever they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I think that that’s a shame. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I kind of feel that I was more immersed in — in — with my family, and my work, rather than — I — I did not think about it unless it came up on the news, or something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  Do you feel that lessons have been learned, the world has learned any lessons from this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I — I think that — I thought so at first, for many years I did think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But now, looking around, I think people — there are those who will try to get rid of anybody who doesn’t think their way, or who they don’t like, or don’t want to deal with, and — an-and — and as far as <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> is concerned, I think it’s — I can’t doMarch 1, 2010 anything about it, so I try not to be — la — I’m really, really concerned and I just feel that after everything is said and done, I don’t know if they’Il ever be peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And that — that’s a very sore point with me, cause I feel that people who — who really built the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> from nothing, why shouldn’t they finally have some peace? </span><span class="sentence" id="101">But — and — and I suppose they do to a certain extent, but they’re always under this siege, and I worry about <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> , and their nuclear bomb, and — but I think that <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> has to just — something, and maybe they will. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I — I don’t think they’re just going to go quietly anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So, I —I feel that — I worry about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I worry about everything that’s happening in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It’s — it’s — it’s just not a — not a peaceful time, and I worry about the future for my children, grandchildren, and really it’s — I do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Are you a member of any survivor groups?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I — for a number of years, I was part of the hidden children group in <span class="REGION">Rockland county</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">It was a small group, and maybe there were 25 of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And we used to meet on the weekly — on a monthly basis, and I found a lot of common ground with — with — with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">They — they all — we were all more or less in the same kind of — in the same page. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And I’m — so, sometimes I — I write to one or two of them, but that was a close group, and I really — that was from the <span class="BUILDING">Marriott hotel</span> we Started that, after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">However, when I came to the united — when I came to <span class="REGION">Washington area</span> , there is a group, but it’s a very, very large group. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">It’s BaltimoreMarch 1, 2010 and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> hidden children. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">They had been a group for about 20 years, even before any of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And I went to a couple of meetings, I really tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">But I’m not terribly outgoing. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Maybe that’s part of the problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And I didn’t feel — they said they welcomed me, but they were such a cl — such a close group, they knew all about each other’s background. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">They had a history, and the — it’s very hard to get into something that — and I — after a while I stopped going. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So I don’t belong to —
QUESTION:  Have you — have you been to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum building</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  What are your thoughts when you walk in there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Well, it was very — first time I — first of all, I went to the opening with Elie Wiesel, and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And I will never, ever forget that, because that was extremely emotional for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I—I cry easily anyway, but it was a — all my children came, and we were all there. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">It was the rainiest day possible, and I thought ... that’s probably the wrong thing to start talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I thought it must be the — the heavens coming down, crying.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  But anyway, I — I did go to that, and then I did go to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And I think it’s extremely well put together. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">It’s — it’s a place that other people can comeMarch 1, 2010 and see what — what was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">It was very realistic, and I was very emotional about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Okay [indecipherable] okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Did you want to put it on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So, we were talking about you — you going into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> itself, and the exhibits. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Did you go upstairs to any of the exhibits when you went into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  Ye-Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  Now, I-I’m not talking about the time of dedication now, obviously.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  No, I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Oh, I — I did go through the —
QUESTION:  And that section on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I’m — I — I went through the whole thing, I’m — I — I think so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Yeah, okay, so it didn’t have particular —
ANSWER:  But it was very — it was many years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  Yeah, okay, so you didn’t have particular memories of going through the section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  Oh, I tell you the truth, tried to kind of go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I d —I didn’t — I couldn’t handle just —
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span><span class="sentence" id="150">March 1, 2010
