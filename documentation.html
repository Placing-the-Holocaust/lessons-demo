    <h2>Documentation for Placing the Holocaust</h2>
    <p>The ArcGIS Online platform “Mapping SS Camps and Ghettos” holds data extracted from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, vol. 1 (2009) and vol. 2 (2012). The mapping platform enables users to visualize and compare the spatial and temporal patterns of perpetrator sites across the German Reich and much of occupied Europe from 1933 to spring 1945. Field definitions are here. We explain our process of iterative, interdisciplinary database design, data entry, and proofing in this journal article, which also explains how we handled the complexity of time in encyclopedia entries. Camp and ghetto locations were determined through a similarly careful process described here</p>
    <p>The “Testimony Search” platform contains 887 English-language interview transcripts from the USHMM Oral History Collection. The place terms in each transcript are highlighted, to enable users to study the geographies of experience embedded in oral histories. Our nine categories of Holocaust places are defined here. While the categories include geographical place names such as settlements, countries, SS camps, and Jewish ghettos, they also cover thousands of other places where important events happened, places where memories were anchored. </p>
