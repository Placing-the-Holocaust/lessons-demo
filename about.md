**Placing the Holocaust** is a web-based platform to share historical and geographical Holocaust data. The main source for the characteristics and events related to SS-administered concentration camps and subcamps (“SS Camps”) and ghettos in German-occupied Eastern Europe (“Ghettos”) were volumes 1 and 2 of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos. We checked camp and ghetto locations using a variety of sources, including Google Earth, Geonames.com, and historical topographic maps available on Mapster.com  http://igrek.amzp.pl/index.php. The places of Holocaust experience on the testimony platform (“Places in survivor testimony”) are tagged in nearly 1,000 transcripts of interviews with Holocaust survivors. The transcripts were provided by the USHMM Oral History Collection. 
This project brings together datasets, maps, and concepts about how to understand the geographies of the Holocaust developed from 2007 to 2023. The camps and ghettos platform was developed chiefly by Maja Kruse. The transcripts platform was developed by Christine Liu, William Mattingly, and Greg Gaines, drawing on concepts developed by Levi Westerveld, Anne Knowles, and Dan Miller. Both platforms and the website were designed by Dan Miller. Gazetteer standards were developed by Maja Kruse and Anne Knowles. Eve Duffy and Paul Jaskot provided historical advice throughout the project. The invaluable assistance of student research assistants is noted below in the full list of project staff.  

Funding for this project came from the National Endowment for the Humanities.  [Other funders to come here.]
